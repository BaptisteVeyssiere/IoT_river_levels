Welcome to group 3's co838 assessment 3.<br>
The code is deployed on a tomcat server using the project member's username as a path.<br>
<br>
Rob's code is here:<br>
<A HREF="http://129.12.44.32/rob/river_levels.jsp">River levels</A><br>
<A HREF="http://129.12.44.32/rob/monitoring_stations.jsp">Monitoring stations</A><br>
<A HREF="http://129.12.44.32/rob/register_subscriber.jsp">Subscriber</A><br>
<br>
Also i have written the C / C++ code for the Mbed device.  it sounds an alarm if the postcode is within the flood area.  I did attempt to view river station levels by station ID but for some reason the function call is displayed on the screen and not sent as a get request.  The mbed assigns itself an IP address using DHCP.<br>
<br>
Endpoints:<br>
/subscribe subscribes the user to the subscriber database, deriving latitude and longitude using teh postcode api.<br>
/check_flooded sends the text message to the subscriber if they are within a flood zone.<br>
Note: subscriber is using a twilio account and will only message registered numbers.<br>
/MBedWarning using the mbed's network mac address this sends a code to the device allowing a user to pair the device with their subscriber information.  In cases where there is a flood the servlet returns the string "flooded" to the device, otherwise it returns the string "dry".<br>
/PhoneWarning not used.<br>
